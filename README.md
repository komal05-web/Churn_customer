# Customer Churn Prediction

## Objective
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify customers at risk of leaving a subscription-based service. By analyzing historical customer data, the model aims to assist businesses in taking proactive measures to improve customer retention.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling for model optimization.
- Implementation of a Decision Tree Classifier for churn prediction.
- Visualization of the decision tree for better interpretability.
- Evaluation of the model using accuracy and precision metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Libraries:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `sklearn`

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is `Churn_Modelling.csv`, containing the following key features:
- **Customer information:** `CustomerId`, `Surname`, `Geography`, `Gender`, `Age`, etc.
- **Account details:** `CreditScore`, `Balance`, `NumOfProducts`, `HasCrCard`, etc.
